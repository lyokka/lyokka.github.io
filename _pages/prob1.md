# Probability 1 Permutation, Combination
-------------------------------------------------------

Before we move to probability we need to define what is permutation and combination.

### Permutation
Example: If we arrange three __a__, __b__ and __c__, three letters. We could have possible result:
  - __a__ __b__ __c__
  - __a__ __c__ __b__
  - __b__ __a__ __c__
  - __b__ __c__ __a__
  - __c__ __a__ __b__
  - __c__ __b__ __a__

Total number of arrangements is __6__. Each arrangement is a ``permutation``. Thus, we know there are __6__ possible permutations.

Without loss of generality, if we arrange __n__ different objects, there will have
$$
  n (n-1) (n-2) ... 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = n!
$$
different permutations.
